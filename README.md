# Mission Planner with AI Chat

A special **fork** of Mission Planner featuring an integrated AI chat assistant for natural language drone control.

Press **Ctrl+L** to chat with your drone using plain English!

## 🤖 What Makes This Special?

This fork adds an AI-powered sidebar to Mission Planner that lets you:
- **Control your drone** using natural language ("take off to 10 meters")
- **Query telemetry** in plain English ("what's my battery level?")
- **Get instant responses** without memorizing commands

**Example:**
```
You: "arm the drone and take off to 15 meters"
AI: ✓ Arming motors... ✓ Taking off to 15m...

You: "how high am I flying?"
AI: Current altitude: 15.3 meters
```
